###	Product Perspective
Before undertaking this project, we studied the ‘Dress Code’ business using various methods. We have started working on this project after obtaining information from the higher officials of the institution and the officials working within the institution.  According to the information obtained from them, they had various software for running the business internally. But their main problem was to expand their business further while maintaining international relations. Therefore, their main request was to develop software to solve this problem. Therefore, upon their request, we took steps to create a suitable app for it. This software is not a modification or modification of any of their existing software. This is a brand-new software that we make for the business under a brand-new concept.
